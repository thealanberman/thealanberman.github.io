            <p class="date">Thursday, August 13, 2009</p>
            <p>
                Pretty much everyone knows that the tech industry is rife with competition. Particularly between rival
                companies
                that make the same damn thing (think Coke vs. Pepsi).
            </p>
            <p>When it comes to computer tech hardware, video graphics
                cards
                are a heated competition. ATI and nVidia are locked in a constant battle for hardware supremacy to have
                the
                highest
                framerates, biggest resolutions, the most onboard memory, and sharpest 3D graphics in the world. Winner
                gets
                the
                bragging rights that come along with it (for a few minutes, anyway, until the competition takes the lead
                again.)</p>
            <p>
                This site isn't about any of that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beneath the nVidia vs. ATI competition is another competition. A more basic
                competition which requires no technical knowledge whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am speaking, of course, of the epically ridiculous artwork which decorates virtually all graphics card
                display boxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is my intention to dedicate this little space
                on the <a href="https://xkcd.com/181/">blog-o-blag</a> to the categorical study of the quest to have the
                most
                fire-breathing 3D dragons riding monster trucks while doing battle with scantilly clad warrior women per
                square
                inch.

                I'm a scientist, and as such I'm faced with the difficult problem of applying objective values on
                something
                as amorphous as art. In order to effectively compare video card box art, I will first establish some
                criteria through which I can give a quantifiable score to any given example.
            </p>
            <p>
                A general survey of my colleagues has resulted in the creation of the following scorecard (see below),
                which
                will be applied to every piece of artwork. One point will be awarded for every instance of every
                category
                example present.

                I'm not really sure what the artist was going for here... Is that some sort of space morning star?
                Perhaps
                some
                kinda space version of a water mine? The übergoth cousin of HAL from 2001? Whatever it is, it looks like
                getting
                near it would result in horrible explosions or lasery red death. Though it also looks like it'd be fun
                to
                ride
                around inside it.

                Asus is not normally a name one thinks of when you hear the term "video card", but the great thing about
                video cards is just about every computer hardware manufacturer out there has branded at least one or two
                graphics cards in their day, which means we won't have to limit ourselves to ATI and nVidia! hoorj~!
            </p>
            <p>
                The artwork on this one is pretty badass. I mean it's basically a D&D artists reworking of Skeletor...
                with
                perky cross-laden golden angel wings. Perhaps he's decided to join the crusades in the holy land?
            </p>
            <p>
                Enough about Skeletor. Let's turn our attention now to two very fascinating points on this box. I'm
                talking
                of course of the words <strong>Heart</strong> and <strong>Touching</strong>. They're arranged right next
                to
                one another rather prominently right under the massive Asus logo, which implies that they're intended to
                be
                read together like a statement. "Heart Touching" -- y'know, like children's books about bunnies who
                sneak
                into Farmer MacGregor's carrot patch, or stories of how a child will donate their kidney to save a dying
                sibling.
            </p>
            <p>
                OK, WHAT THE FLAHGGHAWEGAH!??!?!
            </p>
            <p>
                Sorry Asus, there's nothing less heart touching than a piece of computer hardware. Depictions of weapon
                wielding
                skeletal warriors don't back up your claims. Heart Touching FAIL.
            </p>
            <div class="scorecard">
                <p>
                    Let's rate this guy:<br>
                    +2 Armor (the horse is wearing some too, afterall)<br>
                    +1 Weapon<br>
                    +1 Lightning<br>
                    +1 Fictitious Monster<br>
                    +1 Clouds (I guess that green glowing stuff is a cloud? maybe it's the aurora borealis?)<br>
                    +1 letter X<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The horse is giving me a bit of a dilemma. It's not a predatory animal, despite it's badass horn
                    helmet and
                    it's
                    being used as a vehicle, essentially, which makes me wanna give it at least +1 for the "vehicle
                    implying
                    power"
                    category... but I'm not in a giving mood after that whole "Heart Touching" fiasco.

            <p>
                Oh ZOGIS, how do I love thee? Other graphics card boxes may change their content, they may opt for a
                sexy girl
                in a metal bikini, or a cyborg amphibian, but not you ZOGIS. You have found a formula for getting a
                solid score
                of "2" every time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dragons. Every single box. Not always the same dragon of course, that would be lame. Nope, different
                dragons for
                different cards, but that's it. No werewolf. No wizard. No castle. No maiden in distress. Just dragons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes they swoop down upon some unsuspecting prey just below the edge of the box (look out Linksys
                WRT54G
                Router!)
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes they charge right out of the box towards you, that reptilian eye fixed upon you. Gleaming
                teeth and
                claws poised for ripping you apart. "Buy me and cram me in your home computer or I'll rip your fucking
                lungs
                out! BREEEEAAAAAWK!" Yeah!
            </p>
            <p>
                I could probably dedicate an entire sub-blog solely to ZOGIS dragons, but I won't. We'll just stick with
                this
                guy for now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's see... he's orangey, hes' swooping down, he's um... got some sorta feathery lookin' action going
                on in the
                back there... he likes long walks on the beach, the History category of Trivial Pursuit, and he's
                allergic to

                When some people think of really really baddass videogame elements to put on a box that will really
                inspire
                consumers and move units, they think of Emo Superheros. Enrique, the male model above, is the go-to
                industry guy
                for GeForce whenever they need a wizard or superhero with tribal tattoos and poorly proportioned hands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enrique is all business on the set. Cameras roll and he immediately begins crying his trademark Shiny
                Magnetic
                Tears into his tiny, tiny hands - all while looking completely inconsoleable. He's a total Pro.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given his tribal tat and shredded delts I'm about ready to confirm the rumor that Enrique started his
                carrer in
                the film House-Boat Studs #7 - not that I would watch that but I heard it from somebody don't judge me
                you are
                reading about fantasty art on computer hardware boxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as giving this card a place in the pantheon of Video Card Box art - there were some tough calls
                to be
                made. I, for one, am extremely partial to shiny tears and I think they are pretty badass. He also has a
                kickass
                helmet with a secure looking chinstrap to ensure that it never comes off in combat or while headbanging
                to
                "Fallout Boy." A lot of hard work went into rendering those biceps, and I'm currently pushing the
                Video-Game
                Box-Art Judging Association to add "rad biceps" to the scoring card. But, for now, here are the results:
            </p>
            <div class="scorecard">
                <p>
                    +1 Armor (helmet)<br>
                    +1 Lightning /Water (lightning tears!)<br>
                    +2 for energy bursts<br>
                    +1 Clouds<br>
                    +1 GeForce GTX +1 maXcore 55- has an X and stands for THE MAXIMUM CORE POWER which is clearly 55<br>
                    <p><strong>OVERALL SCORE: 7</strong></p>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Where this Card really stands out is in it's X-ecution (yep). We're talking so many X's I thought I was
                watching
                Sex In the City reruns (yep again).
            </p>
            <p>
                Although tied with the Asus Baddass D&D Skeletor Knight Warrior of Total Badness, this piece is a
                mediocre work
                salvaged only by excessive energy usage and X inflation. I predict not a crowd favorite.

                Wow. The crazy bovine-phobia the artist behind this box suffers from is practically off the scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I know some of you reading this are gonna say "no, that's just a minotaur." -- and to address that,
                I've
                created this short play starring me, as myself, and you as the whiny mythology nerd.

                    You: That's just a minotaur.<br>
                    Me: Minnow what? Shut up or I'll sic a crazy vampire cow warrior on you.<br>
                    You: You have no idea what a minotaur is.<br>
                    Me: You're a minotaur! I'll minotaur you! Your mom's a minotaur!<br>
                    You: I'm done talking to you now.<br>
                    Me: Yeah, you better run Señor Minotaur!<br>
                    You: Your vocabulary is nothing short of amazing.<br>

                epic Robotic Angel of Death on this box art. Whew. The only way to successfully write this post was to
                keep the
                blogpost-typing window (that's blog-tech nerd for a window where you type your blog post) scrolled way
                down so
                that I don't catch any glimpses of this terribly realistic assault.

                The PNY GeForce 9400GT. The "softer side" of the video card industry. Not a weapon or fanged beasty in
                sight!
                Unless of course that's a <em>vampire</em>-level-9-elf-angel-space-alien-princess-healer-mage. Can't tell, since
                her
                mouth is shut in that Mona Lisa smile. She needs a good fantasy name. Harnessing the power of the
                web-o-tubes, I
                have generated a name for her. Henceforth, she shall be <em>Jajaqa of Fairlight</em>!
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it's safe to say that the binary planet action going on in the background there would likely rip
                apart
                any stable orbit system. Jajaqa might wanna think about evacuating whatever rock she's standing on. She
                looks
                like the sorta gal with easy access to a spaceship. Maybe one powered by some hawt steampunk olde tyme
                lookin'
                propellers and some sort of blimp/zeppelin things. Yeah. One thing's for sure, she's lookin' mighty
                lonely
                there. No other life in sight. Not even shrubs. <em>Hey Jajaqa, get some freakin' house plants!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                PNY is clearly hoping that lonely gamer dudes will be overcome with the need to keep Jajaqa company on
                that
                desolate rock. What better way to do that than through the purchase of a video card?

                    +1 Clouds -- they're faint, but they're in there.<br>

                I'm going to go the extra mile and include not just one, but THREE face melting images to burn into your

                First and foremost, you're probably saying "but, that's not a video card!" And you'd be right. I'm an
                adult.
                I'm willing to admit when I'm at fault. That is not a video card. It's a motherboard. It doesn't even
                have some
                crappy built-in video card which I can pretend exempts me from the rules of this blog. Whatever.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might then say to yourself "I refuse to pay attention to any more of this charade until you show me
                a goddamn video card box!"And that's entirely within your purview, go back to moderating Wikipedia.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those of you who are cool with judging motherboard box art for a moment, let's check this baby out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The theme of this box is clearly that of shattering all expectations. You expected some sort of crystal
                orb? HA! We smash your crystals to pieces! <em>Shards in yo' face, fool!</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                How much power does this motherboard have anyway? X! That's how much! but that's not all, it's got that
                bitchin' II after it! Which makes me wonder if this is X to the power of II? or is it merely a Roman XII
                with "power" crammed in the middle? or perhaps it's X multiplied by II to give us XX? Hard to say. Only
                MSI can tell us for certain.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you'll direct your attention to the back side of the box, you'll want to take notice of the feature
                just right of the "Super Pipe". Notice anything unusual? Of course you did. There are SIX GOLDEN BULLETS
                strapped to this motherboard. Clint Eastwood would use this motherboard to take out punks on his front
                lawn, that's how badass MSI engineers are. Don't fuck with MSI engineers.

                    + 1 point for ice (or whatever that shattering material is)<br>
                    + 2 points for energy bursts (one big one, one small one)<br>
                    + 1 point for spikeballs (maybe? I dunno, it seems kinda spikey and ball-esque)<br>
                    + 1 point for fire (there's some reddish firey glow in there, we'll count it)<br>
                    + 2 points for X's, though if it's X to the power of 2, then who knows how many points this really
                    is.<br>
                    + 6 points for bullets. BULLETS. ON A MOTHERBOARD!<br>

                Once again I'm bending my own rules because for some reason or other the VIDEO CARD BOX ART INDUSTRY has
                collapsed. (Perhaps it's based in some country with an unstable economy?) There's really a general lack
                of
                worthwhile box art coming out these days.

                Or at least that's what I assume this app does. Maybe it's a game. I dunno, I didn't read the details
                that
                closely, as I was busy fearing for my soul.

                Let's rate this thing as best we can... Perhaps I'll have to make a new scorecard for app artwork?

            <div class="scorecard">
                <p>
                    GUYS!!!! Let's total this thing up! I have a feeling this is going to set a new precedent!
                </p>
                <p>
                    +8 for Fictitious Monsters (they're EVERYWHERE!)<br>
                    +2 for Energy Bursts (I only see 2? It's hard to tell what with all the fire and lightning)<br>
                    +15 for Armor (Honestly, I lost count of how many characters are in this image, but let's assume
                    they're all
                    coated in enchanted Adamantium Mithril Helms)<br>
                    +1 for Lightning<br>
                    +1 for Fire<br>
                    +3 for Weapons (I see a sword IN THE LOGO OF THE GAME. How badass is that??)<br>
                    +3 for Wizards (Those girls are wizards right? Or is that the same girl 3 times?)<br>
                    +1 for whatever you wanna call that glowing blurry claw mark thing<br>
                </p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Total: 34 — A NEW RECORD!!!</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Perhaps all of the video card box art artists have gone the way of the App?
