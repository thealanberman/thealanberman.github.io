            <title>Episode 001 "Samples"</title>
            <description>
KMFDM - We Must Awaken
Khuskan - Atomic
Information Society - A Knife and a Fork
David Guetta - Atomic Food
Mike Doughty - More Bacon Than the Pan Can Handle
Master Cylinder - Jung at Heart
M/A/R/R/S - Pump Up the Volume
Pop Will Eat Itself - Can U Dig It?
Messiah - Temple of Dreams
The Timelords - Doctorin' the Tardis
Kon Kan - I Beg Your Pardon
Negativland - The Greatest Taste Around

So, this episode is more of a mixtape than a podcast. There's no talking. I did my best with my meager mixing skills to make it seamless. The general "theme" is songs which feature audio samples heavily, because I love songs that sample other audio. I particularly love when after listening to a song for years I stumble across where the audio sample actually came from! For example, in this mix the intro sample to _Can U Dig It?_ by Pop Will Eat Itself is lifted from The Warriors. I didn't know that for years. It's like a lifetime easter egg hunt. (Yes, I could just Google it, but what's the fun in that?)

Recently I discovered there's an entire genre known as Plunderphonics which includes music like this mix, as well as audio collages, mashups, and similar works.

Given this is my first episode, expect the format will change in subsequent episodes. Apologies if it proves to be a bumpy ride.

            <title>Episode 002 "Drugs"</title>
            <description>
Strawberry Alarm Clock - Incense &amp; Peppermints
Underworld - Cowgirl
The Dandy Warhols - Holding Me Up
Electric Six - I Buy the Drugs
Matthew Dear - You Put a Smell on Me
Clutch - Drink to the Dead
Land of the Loops - Multi-Family Garage Sale
Babble - Come Down
Brad Sucks - Dropping Out of School

Another mixtape. I'm having a bit of decision paralysis about what to say about these mixes, or how to format them if I include some talking. Perhaps I'll record some talking addendums for these episodes soon, but for now I'll just write things in these little blurbs.

The theme for this one is "drugs" which is not really any reflection on my own experiences, but I find I do like a lot of music associated with drugs. Old psychedelic music from the 60s, trance music, neo-psychedelic rock from the mid-90s up to today, stoner metal, etc.

While not all of these tracks strictly fit in those genres, they all somewhat revolve around the topic of drugs, or seem (to me at least) to have been composed while under the influence of mind altering substances.

Anyhoo, I enjoy all these tracks regardless of mind altering substances, so hopefully you will as well.

            <title>Episode 003 "Strange"</title>
            <description>
Wanderlust - Lou Reed
Strange Talk - Eskimo Boy
Lemon Interrupt - Minniapolis
The Prodigy - Mindfields
Lo-Fidelity All-Stars - Battle Flag
The Suburbs - Music for Boys
Strange Advance - We Run
Black Rebel Motorcycle Club - Lien On Your Dreams
Baroness - Tourniquet

Definitely cranking out the mixtapes. I have a fever... and the only prescription is mixtapes. Will I ever do another format? WHO KNOWS! (The Shadow knows?)

I don't know that this episode even has a theme. Just a jumble of songs that I like. Which is pretty much how I approached mixtapes back in days of yore.

And yes, I know _"Minniapolis"_ is the wrong spelling. That's how it's spelled on the record label. If you have an issue with that, take it up with Lemon Interrupt (a.k.a Underworld).

            <title>Episode 004 "Wallow"</title>
            <description>
The Wrens - She Sends Kisses
Sisters of Mercy - I Was Wrong
Haley Bonar - Drinking Again
Mazzy Star - Into Dust
Speck Mountain - Backsliding
Still Corners - The Trip
Bon Iver - For Emma
Red House Painters - New Jersey
Cracker - Big Dipper

If you're in a good mood, probably best to skip this one for now.

This one is definitely a "down note" mix. Most of these songs have served as a soundrack I put on when I felt like wallowing in misery.

I generally dislike female vocals in songs, but apparently that rule doesn't apply as long as the song is slow, sad and probably with some echo effect. Personal preferences are weird.

The Sisters of Mercy track reminds me I should do a goth/post-punk/darkwave mix. Maybe up next?

            <title>Episode 005 "Music for Bikes"</title>
            <description>
Spencer Davis Group - Gimme Some Lovin'
Matt Berry - The Signs
The Cult - Rain
Lou Gramm - Midnight Blue
Sparklehorse - Someday I Will Treat You Good
Electric Guest - This Head I Hold
Sturgill Simpson - Sing Along
Deadmau5 feat. Rob Swire - Ghosts n' Stuff
Apoptygma Berzerk - Coma White
The Presets - This Boy's in Love
Utah Saints - Something Good '09
Covenant - Tension
Holy Ghost! - Do It Again

In 1978, Brian Eno released his seminal work _Music for Airports_, coining the genre "Ambient Music" in the process. And while that album is interesting and worth checking out when the mood is right, it's horrible music for a workout. (Maybe listen to it in an airport?)

This mix is "Music for Bikes" because biking is my favorite form of exercise, and recently I got some awesome Aftershokz headphones which means I can listen while I ride!

This mixtape is fairly high-energy. I tried to start off with some rock n' roll and then dive into the more electronic side of things.

Fun Facts!

- Matt Berry is better known for his comedic acting. He's been in many BBC shows, including _The IT Crowd_ and _The Mighty Boosh_.
- Lou Gramm is better known as the lead singer of Foreigner.
- Sturgill Simpson is primarily a country singer. His _Sound & Fury_ rock album, which _Sing Along_ is from, was released on Netflix as a long form anime music video. Definitely worth watching.
- The version of _Coma White_ in this mix is actually a cover of a Marilyn Manson song.

            <title>Episode 006 "Garage"</title>
            <description>
Father John Misty - Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings
The Mighty Lemon Drops - Out of Hand
Pickwick - Hacienda Motel
The Smithereens - Behind the Wall of Sleep
The Castaways - Liar, Liar
Fitz and the Tantrums - Don't Gotta Work It Out
The Black Keys - Tighten Up
My Morning Jacket - The Day is Coming
Band of Horses - Ode to LRC
Spoon - The Beast and Dragon, Adored
Shawn Lee - River Man
Say Hi To Your Mom - A Hit in Sweden

I don't necesarily think every song in this mix qualifies as "Garage Rock", but they all kinda circle around that style. The combination of lo-fi recording and simple melodies reminds me of the songs I grew up listening to in the car; my mom's oldies station. Nearly every song in this mix owes itself to Motown or the British Invasion. Even _Liar, Liar_, which was a contemporary song from the 60s, but Garage Rock was basically America's answer to the British Invasion.

Fun Facts!

- _Hacienda Motel_ is about Sam Cooke's murder at the Hacienda Hotel in Los Angeles, California.
- _Behind the Wall of Sleep_ was written about Kim Ernst, the bassist for a band called The Bristols-Boston. The lyrics compare her to Jean Shrimpton, a 60s supermodel, and Bill Wyman, the bassist for The Rolling Stones.
- The Castaways never released a full album. Just a handful of singles.
- The Castaways released _Liar, Liar_ on a split single with their fellow Minnesotans The Trashmen's _Surfin' Bird_.
- Fitz and the Tantrums owes its entire existence to lead singer Michael Fitzpatrick acquiring an old Conn electric organ. It features heavily on their debut album _Pickin' Up The Pieces_.
- The piano parts in _The Beast and Dragon, Adored_ were recorded "illegally" by sneaking into the piano lab at the University of Texas music building with some recording equipment.
- Say Hi To Your Mom is basically a solo project of Eric Elbogen. Eric has since shortened the name to just "Say Hi". Many Say Hi songs tend to involve vampires, robots, and movie references.

            <title>Episode 007 "Mope"</title>
            <description>
Will Johnson - Just To Know What You've Been Dreaming
Beck - Guess I'm Doing Fine
Idlewild - Welcome Home
Jets To Brazil - Sea Anemone
Mad Season - Wake Up
Peter Murphy - I'll Fall With Your Knife
The Smiths - Death of a Disco Dancer
Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here
Cigarettes After Sex - Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby

This mix feels mostly like a sequel to Episode 004 "Wallow".

Perhaps I should have titled it "Wallow Side B", in keeping with the mix tape theme.

I guess I like mopey music, or at least I certainly don't shy away from it.

Hmm, let's see,  what can I say about this mix?

Fun Facts!

- Will Johnson is also the lead singer of the bands _South San Gabriel_ and _Centro-matic_.
- Beck's album _Sea Change_ is one of those rare albums where I can listen to it start to finish and there are no bad tracks I'd rather skip.
- Despite Idlewild's often country-ish sound... they're Scottish. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
- Jets to Brazil got their name from a travel poster on the wall in a scene from _Breakfast At Tiffany's_.
- Mad Season is a "supergroup" consisting of members of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and The Screaming Trees.
- Peter Murphy is the former lead singer of the pioneering goth band Bauhaus.
- The Smiths' lead singer Morrissey has made some truly reprehensible statements over the years, but I enjoy his lyrics and vocals in spite of his being a terrible person.
- Cigarettes After Sex recorded their first EP in a four-story stairway at the University of Texas, El Paso. The quite androgynous sounding lead singer is Greg Gonzales.

            <title>Episode 008 "No Plan"</title>
            <description>
Electric Six - (It Gets) (A Little) Jumpy
Scissor Sisters - Comfortably Numb
Zoot Woman - Gem
Re-Flex - The Politics of Dancing
Wumpscut - Wreath of Barbs
The Servant - Cells (Instrumental)
Black Rebel Motorcycle Club - All You Do Is Talk
The Psychedelic Furs - There's A World Outside
Icehouse - Hey Little Girl
Semisonic - Secret Smile
Mike Doughty - Tigers Mirrors Mazes Dreams

If there's a theme to this mix, I don't know what it is. 

Just a jumble of songs I like and hope go together.

Fun Facts!

- A critic once described Electric Six's music as "macho flippancy" and "tongue-in-cheek pomposity". Lead singer Dick Valentine estimates "90 percent of our songs, maybe even higher than 90 percent are about absolutely nothing."
