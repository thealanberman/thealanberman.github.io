                <p>Don&rsquo;t really have much to say about this mix. Probably at least half of these tracks could
                    qualify for the &ldquo;Chillwave&rdquo; genre, if that even counts as a genre.</p>
                <p>I saw All Hail The Silence open for Howard Jones in Seattle back in 2019. I was surprised when I
                    discovered the guest vocalist for AHTS was Brian Transeau (a.k.a. &ldquo;BT&rdquo;) because I had
                    seen BT open for The Crystal Method back in 1998! Thus proving I am old.</p>
                <p>Unintentionally, this mix features 3 bands from Australia. Time to dig up some fun facts!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Both William Fitzsimmons&rsquo; parents are blind. (William is not blind.)</li>
                    <li>Washed Out is probably best known for the theme song to <em>Portlandia</em>.</li>
                    <li>MTNS are from Brisbane, Australia.</li>
                    <li>The Presets are from Sydney, Australia.</li>
                    <li>Tame Impala is from Perth, Australia.</li>
                    <li>Vocalist David Reilly of God Lives Underwater died of complications from a tooth infection.

                <p>Talk Talk started out as a synthpop band in the early 80s. They had some minor radio hits, most
                    notably the 1984 hit <a href="https://youtu.be/cFH5JgyZK1I"><em>It&rsquo;s My Life</em></a>.
                    However, if you look at Talk Talk&rsquo;s studio discography, there&rsquo;s a very clear trajectory
                    towards something quite different. The first 2 albums are just standard pop. Their 3rd album,
                    <em>The Colour of Spring</em> (1986), hints at a new direction. The track <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/cRx0rqqTetc"><em>April 5th</em></a> in particular shows what&rsquo;s to
                    come. Their final 2 albums move away from traditional pop song structures and into free-jazz
                    orchestral soundscapes and pioneered what would later become known as &ldquo;Post Rock&rdquo;.</p>
                <p><em>The Rainbow</em> is the opening track from their fourth album <em>Spirit of Eden</em> (1988).
                    Other than Mark Hollis&rsquo; vocals, it&rsquo;s unrecognizable as the same band that produced
                    <em>It&rsquo;s My Life</em> only 4 years prior.</p>
                <p>The term &ldquo;Post Rock&rdquo; was applied retroactively once other bands followed in their
                    footsteps. Bark Psychosis&rsquo; <em>Hex</em> album helped solidify the term. Post Rock
                    approximately encompasses any music produced using traditional rock instruments, but not following
                    traditional rock structures. The results tend to be long, winding instrumental pieces up to an hour
                    long.</p>
                <p>An hour is not a lot of time to fit multiple Post Rock tracks, but this&rsquo;ll have to do.</p>

                    <p>Fun Facts!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A critic once described Electric Six&rsquo;s music as &ldquo;macho flippancy&rdquo; and
                            &ldquo;tongue-in-cheek pomposity&rdquo;. Lead singer Dick Valentine estimates &ldquo;90
                            percent of our songs, maybe even higher than 90 percent are about absolutely nothing.&rdquo;
                        </li>
                        <li><em>Comfortably Numb</em> is, of course, originally by Pink Floyd. This version reimagines
                            it as a Beegees song.</li>
                        <li>Robert Levon Been, of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, is the son of Michael Been from <em>The
                                Call</em>.</li>
                        <li>:wumpscut: was the project of German DJ Rudy Ratzinger. Despite being active from 1991 to
                            2016, it was a studio-only project and never toured.</li>
                        <li>The movie <em>Pretty in Pink</em> is named after the Psychedelic Furs song. Not the other
                            way around. Molly Ringwald was a fan of the Furs.</li>
                        <li>The instrumental version of <em>Cells</em> has been featured in several movies and movie
                            trailers.</li>
                        <li>Dan Wilson and John Munson of Semisonic were also both members of the band Trip Shakespeare.
                            Both bands have a star on the outside of the iconic First Avenue club in Minneapolis.</li>
                        <li>Mike Doughty, former lead singer of Soul Coughing, has a <a
                                href="https://www.patreon.com/doughty">Patreon</a> where he releases songs weekly (if

                        <li>Beck&rsquo;s album <em>Sea Change</em> is one of those rare albums where I can listen to it
                            start to finish and there are no bad tracks I&rsquo;d rather skip.</li>
                        <li>Despite Idlewild&rsquo;s often country-ish sound&hellip; they&rsquo;re Scottish.

                        <li>Jets to Brazil got their name from a travel poster on the wall in a scene from <em>Breakfast
                                At Tiffany&rsquo;s</em>.</li>
                        <li>Mad Season is a &ldquo;supergroup&rdquo; consisting of members of Pearl Jam, Alice in
                            Chains, and The Screaming Trees.</li>
                        <li>Peter Murphy is the former lead singer of the pioneering goth band Bauhaus.</li>
                        <li>The Smiths&rsquo; lead singer Morrissey has made some truly reprehensible statements over
                            the years, but I enjoy his lyrics and vocals in spite of his being a terrible person.</li>
                        <li>Cigarettes After Sex recorded their first EP in a four-story stairway at the University of

                    <p>I don&rsquo;t necesarily think every song in this mix qualifies as &ldquo;Garage Rock&rdquo;, but
                        they all kinda circle around that style. The combination of lo-fi recording and simple melodies
                        reminds me of the songs I grew up listening to in the car; my mom&rsquo;s oldies station. Nearly
                        every song in this mix owes itself to Motown or the British Invasion. Even <em>Liar, Liar</em>,
                        which was a contemporary song from the 60s, but Garage Rock was basically America&rsquo;s answer
                        to the British Invasion.</p>
                    <p>Fun Facts!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Hacienda Motel</em> is about Sam Cooke&rsquo;s murder at the Hacienda Hotel in Los
                            Angeles, California.</li>
                        <li><em>Behind the Wall of Sleep</em> was written about Kim Ernst, the bassist for a band called
                            The Bristols-Boston. The lyrics compare her to Jean Shrimpton, a 60s supermodel, and Bill
                            Wyman, the bassist for The Rolling Stones.</li>
                        <li>The Castaways never released a full album. Just a handful of singles.</li>
                        <li>The Castaways released <em>Liar, Liar</em> on a split single with their fellow Minnesotans
                            The Trashmen&rsquo;s <em>Surfin&rsquo; Bird</em>.</li>
                        <li>Fitz and the Tantrums owes its entire existence to lead singer Michael Fitzpatrick acquiring
                            an old Conn electric organ. It features heavily on their debut album <em>Pickin&rsquo; Up
                                The Pieces</em>.</li>
                        <li>The piano parts in <em>The Beast and Dragon, Adored</em> were recorded
                            &ldquo;illegally&rdquo; by sneaking into the piano lab at the University of Texas music
                            building with some recording equipment.</li>
                        <li>Say Hi To Your Mom is basically a solo project of Eric Elbogen. Eric has since shortened the
                            name to just &ldquo;Say Hi&rdquo;. Many Say Hi songs tend to involve vampires, robots, and
                            movie references.</li>

                    <p>In 1978, Brian Eno released his seminal work <em>Music for Airports</em>, coining the genre
                        &ldquo;Ambient Music&rdquo; in the process. And while that album is interesting and worth
                        checking out when the mood is right, it&rsquo;s horrible music for a workout. (Maybe listen to
                        it in an airport?)</p>
                    <p>This mix is &ldquo;Music for Bikes&rdquo; because biking is my favorite form of exercise, and
                        recently I got some awesome Aftershokz headphones which means I can listen while I ride!</p>
                    <p>This mixtape is fairly high-energy. I tried to start off with some rock n&rsquo; roll and then
                        dive into the more electronic side of things.</p>
                    <p>Fun Facts!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Matt Berry is better known for his comedic acting. He&rsquo;s been in many BBC shows,
                            including <em>The IT Crowd</em> and <em>The Mighty Boosh</em>.</li>
                        <li>Lou Gramm is better known as the lead singer of Foreigner.</li>
                        <li>Sturgill Simpson is primarily a country singer. His <em>Sound &amp; Fury</em> rock album,
                            which <em>Sing Along</em> is from, was released on Netflix as a long form anime music video.
                            Definitely worth watching.</li>
                        <li>The version of <em>Coma White</em> in this mix is actually a cover of a Marilyn Manson song.
                        </li>

                    <p>If you&rsquo;re in a good mood, probably best to skip this one for now.</p>
                    <p>This one is definitely a &ldquo;down note&rdquo; mix. Most of these songs have served as a
                        soundrack I put on when I felt like wallowing in misery.</p>
                    <p>I generally dislike female vocals in songs, but apparently that rule doesn&rsquo;t apply as long
                        as the song is slow, sad and probably with some echo effect. Personal preferences are weird.</p>
                    <p>The Sisters of Mercy track reminds me I should do a goth/post-punk/darkwave mix. Maybe up next?

                    <p>Another mixtape. I&rsquo;m having a bit of decision paralysis about what to say about these
                        mixes, or how to format them if I include some talking. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll record some talking
                        addendums for these episodes soon, but for now I&rsquo;ll just write things in these little
                        blurbs.</p>
                    <p>The theme for this one is &ldquo;drugs&rdquo; which is not really any reflection on my own
                        experiences, but I find I do like a lot of music associated with drugs. Old psychedelic music
                        from the 60s, trance music, neo-psychedelic rock from the mid-90s up to today, stoner metal,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>While not all of these tracks strictly fit in those genres, they all somewhat revolve around the
                        topic of drugs, or seem (to me at least) to have been composed while under the influence of mind
                        altering substances.</p>
                    <p>Anyhoo, I enjoy all these tracks regardless of mind altering substances, so hopefully you will as
                        well.</p>

                    <p>So, this episode is more of a mixtape than a podcast. There&rsquo;s no talking. I did my best
                        with my meager mixing skills to make it seamless. The general &ldquo;theme&rdquo; is songs which
                        feature audio samples heavily, because I love songs that sample other audio. I particularly love
                        when after listening to a song for years I stumble across where the audio sample actually came
                        from! For example, in this mix the intro sample to <em>Can U Dig It?</em> by Pop Will Eat Itself
                        is lifted from The Warriors. I didn&rsquo;t know that for years. It&rsquo;s like a lifetime
                        easter egg hunt. (Yes, I could just Google it, but what&rsquo;s the fun in that?)</p>
                    <p>Recently I discovered there&rsquo;s an entire genre known as Plunderphonics which includes music
                        like this mix, as well as audio collages, mashups, and similar works.</p>
                    <p>Given this is my first episode, expect the format will change in subsequent episodes. Apologies
                        if it proves to be a bumpy ride.</p>
