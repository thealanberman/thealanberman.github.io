                    <p>So, this episode is more of a mixtape than a podcast. There's no talking. I did my best with my
                        meager mixing skills to make it seamless. The general "theme" is songs which
                        feature audio samples heavily, because I love songs that sample other audio. 
                        I particularly love when after listening to a song for
                        years I stumble across where the audio sample actually came from! For example, in this mix the
                        intro sample to <em>Can U Dig It?</em> by Pop Will Eat Itself is lifted from
                        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/">The Warriors</a>.
                        I didn't know that for <em>years</em>. It's like a lifetime easter egg hunt.
                        (Yes, I could just Google it, but what's the fun in that?)
                    </p>
                    <p>Recently I discovered there's an entire genre known as
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunderphonics">Plunderphonics</a> which includes music
                        like this mix, as well as audio collages, mashups, and similar works.</p>
                    <p>Given this is my first episode, expect the format will change in subsequent episodes. Apologies
                        if it proves to be a bumpy ride.</p>

                    <p>Another mixtape. I'm having a bit of decision paralysis about what to say about these mixes, or how to format them if I include some talking. Perhaps I'll record some talking addendums for these episodes soon, but for now I'll just write things in these little blurbs.</p>
                    <p>The theme for this one is "drugs" which is not really any reflection on my own experiences, but I find I do like a lot of music associated with drugs. Old psychedelic music from the 60s, trance music, neo-psychedelic rock from the mid-90s up to today, stoner metal, etc.</p>
                    <p>While not all of these tracks strictly fit in those genres, they all somewhat revolve around the topic of drugs, or seem (to me at least) to have been composed while under the influence of mind altering substances.</p>
                    <p>Anyhoo, I enjoy all these tracks even without mind altering substances, so hopefully you will as well.</p>
