      So, this is more of a collection of mixtapes than a podcast. There's no talking. I did my best with my meager mixing skills to make it seamless. The general "theme" is songs which feature audio samples heavily, because I love songs that sample other audio. I particularly love when after listening to a song for years I stumble across where the audio sample actually came from! For example, in this mix the intro sample to _Can U Dig It?_ by Pop Will Eat Itself is lifted from The Warriors. I didn't know that for years. It's like a lifetime easter egg hunt. (Yes, I could just Google it, but what's the fun in that?)

      Recently I discovered there's an entire genre known as Plunderphonics which includes music like this mix, as well as audio collages, mashups, and similar works.

      Given this is my first episode, expect the format will change in subsequent episodes. Apologies if it proves to be a bumpy ride.

      Another mixtape. I'm having a bit of decision paralysis about what to say about these mixes, or how to format them if I include some talking. Perhaps I'll record some talking addendums for these episodes soon, but for now I'll just write things in these little blurbs.

      The theme for this one is "drugs" which is not really any reflection on my own experiences, but I find I do like a lot of music associated with drugs. Old psychedelic music from the 60s, trance music, neo-psychedelic rock from the mid-90s up to today, stoner metal, etc.

      While not all of these tracks strictly fit in those genres, they all somewhat revolve around the topic of drugs, or seem (to me at least) to have been composed while under the influence of mind altering substances.

      Anyhoo, I enjoy all these tracks regardless of mind altering substances, so hopefully you will as well.

      Definitely cranking out the mixtapes. I have a fever... and the only prescription is mixtapes. Will I ever do another format? WHO KNOWS! (The Shadow knows?)

      I don't know that this episode even has a theme. Just a jumble of songs that I like. Which is pretty much how I approached mixtapes back in days of yore.

      And yes, I know _"Minniapolis"_ is the wrong spelling. That's how it's spelled on the record label. If you have an issue with that, take it up with Lemon Interrupt (a.k.a Underworld).

      If you're in a good mood, probably best to skip this one for now.

      This one is definitely a "down note" mix. Most of these songs have served as a soundrack I put on when I felt like wallowing in misery.

      I generally dislike female vocals in songs, but apparently that rule doesn't apply as long as the song is slow, sad and probably with some echo effect. Personal preferences are weird.

      The Sisters of Mercy track reminds me I should do a goth/post-punk/darkwave mix. Maybe up next?
