                <p>This mix feels mostly like a sequel to Episode 004 "Wallow".</p>
                <p>Perhaps I should have titled it "Wallow Side B", in keeping with the mix tape theme.</p>
                <p>I guess I like mopey music, or at least I certainly don't shy away from it.</p>
                <p>Hmm, let's see... what can I say about this mix? ü§î</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fun Facts!</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Will Johnson is also the lead singer of the bands <em>South San Gabriel</em> and
                            <em>Centro-matic</em>.</li>
                        <li>Beck's album <em>Sea Change</em> is one of those rare albums where I can listen to it start
                            to finish and there are no bad tracks I'd rather skip.</li>
                        <li>Despite Idlewild's often country-ish sound... they're Scottish. üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø</li>
                        <li>Jets to Brazil got their name from a travel poster on the wall in a scene from <em>Breakfast
                                At Tiffany's</em>.</li>
                        <li>Mad Season is a "supergroup" consisting of members of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and The
                            Screaming Trees.</li>
                        <li>Peter Murphy is the former lead singer of the pioneering goth band Bauhaus.</li>
                        <li>The Smiths lead singer Morrissey has made some truly reprehensible statements over the
                            years, but I enjoy his lyrics and vocals in spite of it.</li>
                        <li>Cigarettes After Sex recorded their first EP in a four-story stairway at the University of
                            Texas, El Paso. The <em>quite androgynous</em> sounding lead singer is Greg Gonzales.</li>

                </p>
                <p>I don't necesarily think every song in this mix qualifies as "Garage Rock", but they all kinda circle
                    around that style. The combination of lo-fi recording and simple melodies reminds me of the songs I
                    grew up listening to in the car; my mom's oldies station. Nearly every song in this mix owes itself
                    to Motown or the British Invasion. Even <em>Liar, Liar</em>, which was a contemporary song from the
                    60s, but Garage Rock was basically America's answer to the British Invasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fun Facts!</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Hacienda Motel</em> is about Sam Cooke's murder at the Hacienda Hotel in Los Angeles,
                            California.</li>
                        <li><em>Behind the Wall of Sleep</em> was written about Kim Ernst, the bassist for a band
                            called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Bristols-Boston-178964242712080">The
                                Bristols-Boston</a>. The lyrics compare her to Jean Shrimpton, a 60s supermodel, and
                            Bill Wyman, the bassist for The Rolling Stones.</li>
                        <li>The Castaways never released a full album. Just a handful of singles.</li>
                        <li>The Castaways released <em>Liar, Liar</em> on a split single with their fellow Minnesotans
                            The Trashmen's <a href="https://youtu.be/Qgmh0BjLKVM"><em>Surfin' Bird</em></a>.</li>
                        <li>Fitz and the Tantrums owes its entire existence to lead singer Michael Fitzpatrick acquiring
                            an old Conn electric organ. It features heavily on their debut album <em>Pickin' Up The
                                Pieces</em>.</li>
                        <li>The piano parts in <em>The Beast and Dragon, Adored</em> were recorded "illegally" by
                            sneaking into the piano lab at the University of Texas music building with some recording
                            equipment.</li>
                        <li>Say Hi To Your Mom is basically a solo project of Eric Elbogen. Eric has since shortened the
                            name to just "Say Hi". Many Say Hi songs tend to involve vampires, robots, and movie
                            references.</li>

                <p>In 1978, Brian Eno released his seminal work <em>Music for Airports</em>, coining the genre
                    "Ambient Music" in the process.
                    And while that album is interesting and worth checking out when the mood is right, it's horrible
                    music for a workout. (Maybe listen to it in an airport?)</p>
                <p>This mix is "Music for Bikes" because biking is my favorite form of exercise, and recently I got some
                    awesome <a href="https://aftershokz.com/">Aftershokz</a> headphones which means I can listen while I
                    ride!</p>
                <p>This mixtape is fairly high-energy. I tried to start off with some rock n' roll and then dive into
                    the more electronic side of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Fun Facts!</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Matt Berry is better known for his comedic acting. He's been in many BBC shows,
                            including <em>The IT Crowd</em> and <em>The Mighty Boosh</em>.</li>
                        <li>Lou Gramm is better known as the lead singer of Foreigner.</li>
                        <li>Sturgill Simpson is primarily a country singer. His <em>Sound & Fury</em> rock album,
                            which <em>Sing Along</em> is from, was released on Netflix as a long form anime music
                            video. Definitely worth watching.</li>
                        <li>The version of <em>Coma White</em> in this mix is actually a cover of a Marilyn Manson
                            song.</li>

                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>If you're in a good mood, probably best to skip this one for now.</p>
                <p>This one is definitely a "down note" mix. Most of these songs have served as a soundrack I put on
                    when I felt like wallowing in misery.</p>
                <p>I generally dislike female vocals in songs, but apparently that rule doesn't apply as long as the
                    song is slow, sad and probably with some echo effect. Personal preferences are weird.</p>
                <p>The Sisters of Mercy track reminds me I should do a goth/post-punk/darkwave mix. Maybe up next?</p>

                <p>Definitely cranking out the mixtapes. I have a fever... and the only prescription is mixtapes.
                    Will I ever do another format? WHO KNOWS! (The Shadow knows?)</p>
                <p>I don't know that this episode even has a theme. Just a jumble of songs that I like. Which is
                    pretty much how I approached mixtapes back in days of yore.</p>
                <p>And yes, I know "Minniapolis" is the wrong spelling. That's how it's spelled on the record label.

                <p>Another mixtape. I'm having a bit of decision paralysis about what to say about these mixes, or
                    how to format them if I include some talking. Perhaps I'll record some talking addendums for
                    these episodes soon, but for now I'll just write things in these little blurbs.</p>
                <p>The theme for this one is "drugs" which is not really any reflection on my own experiences, but I
                    find I do like a lot of music associated with drugs. Old psychedelic music from the 60s, trance
                    music, neo-psychedelic rock from the mid-90s up to today, stoner metal, etc.</p>
                <p>While not all of these tracks strictly fit in those genres, they all somewhat revolve around the
                    topic of drugs, or seem (to me at least) to have been composed while under the influence of mind
                    altering substances.</p>
                <p>Anyhoo, I enjoy all these tracks regardless of mind altering substances, so hopefully you will as
                    well.</p>

                <p>So, this episode is more of a mixtape than a podcast. There's no talking. I did my best with my
                    meager mixing skills to make it seamless. The general "theme" is songs which
                    feature audio samples heavily, because I love songs that sample other audio.
                    I particularly love when after listening to a song for
                    years I stumble across where the audio sample actually came from! For example, in this mix the
                    intro sample to <em>Can U Dig It?</em> by Pop Will Eat Itself is lifted from
                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/">The Warriors</a>.
                    I didn't know that for <em>years</em>. It's like a lifetime easter egg hunt.
                    (Yes, I could just Google it, but what's the fun in that?)
                </p>
                <p>Recently I discovered there's an entire genre known as
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunderphonics">Plunderphonics</a> which includes music
                    like this mix, as well as audio collages, mashups, and similar works.</p>
                <p>Given this is my first episode, expect the format will change in subsequent episodes. Apologies
                    if it proves to be a bumpy ride.</p>
