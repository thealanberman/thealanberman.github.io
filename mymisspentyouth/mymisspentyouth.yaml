      So, this is more of a collection of mixtapes than a podcast. There's no talking. I did my best with my meager mixing skills to make it seamless. The general "theme" is songs which feature audio samples heavily, because I love songs that sample other audio. I particularly love when after listening to a song for years I stumble across where the audio sample actually came from! For example, in this mix the intro sample to _Can U Dig It?_ by Pop Will Eat Itself is lifted from The Warriors. I didn't know that for years. It's like a lifetime easter egg hunt. (Yes, I could just Google it, but what's the fun in that?)

      Recently I discovered there's an entire genre known as Plunderphonics which includes music like this mix, as well as audio collages, mashups, and similar works.

      Given this is my first episode, expect the format will change in subsequent episodes. Apologies if it proves to be a bumpy ride.

      Another mixtape. I'm having a bit of decision paralysis about what to say about these mixes, or how to format them if I include some talking. Perhaps I'll record some talking addendums for these episodes soon, but for now I'll just write things in these little blurbs.

      The theme for this one is "drugs" which is not really any reflection on my own experiences, but I find I do like a lot of music associated with drugs. Old psychedelic music from the 60s, trance music, neo-psychedelic rock from the mid-90s up to today, stoner metal, etc.

      While not all of these tracks strictly fit in those genres, they all somewhat revolve around the topic of drugs, or seem (to me at least) to have been composed while under the influence of mind altering substances.

      Anyhoo, I enjoy all these tracks regardless of mind altering substances, so hopefully you will as well.

      Definitely cranking out the mixtapes. I have a fever... and the only prescription is mixtapes. Will I ever do another format? WHO KNOWS! (The Shadow knows?)

      I don't know that this episode even has a theme. Just a jumble of songs that I like. Which is pretty much how I approached mixtapes back in days of yore.

      And yes, I know _"Minniapolis"_ is the wrong spelling. That's how it's spelled on the record label. If you have an issue with that, take it up with Lemon Interrupt (a.k.a Underworld).

    notes: |
      If you're in a good mood, probably best to skip this one for now.

      This one is definitely a "down note" mix. Most of these songs have served as a soundrack I put on when I felt like wallowing in misery.

      I generally dislike female vocals in songs, but apparently that rule doesn't apply as long as the song is slow, sad and probably with some echo effect. Personal preferences are weird.

      The Sisters of Mercy track reminds me I should do a goth/post-punk/darkwave mix. Maybe up next?

      In 1978, Brian Eno released his seminal work _Music for Airports_, coining the genre "Ambient Music" in the process. And while that album is interesting and worth checking out when the mood is right, it's horrible music for a workout. (Maybe listen to it in an airport?)

      This mix is "Music for Bikes" because biking is my favorite form of exercise, and recently I got some awesome Aftershokz headphones which means I can listen while I ride!

      This mixtape is fairly high-energy. I tried to start off with some rock n' roll and then dive into the more electronic side of things.

      Fun Facts!

      - Matt Berry is better known for his comedic acting. He's been in many BBC shows, including _The IT Crowd_ and _The Mighty Boosh_.
      - Lou Gramm is better known as the lead singer of Foreigner.
      - Sturgill Simpson is primarily a country singer. His _Sound & Fury_ rock album, which _Sing Along_ is from, was released on Netflix as a long form anime music video. Definitely worth watching.
      - The version of _Coma White_ in this mix is actually a cover of a Marilyn Manson song.

    notes: |
      I don't necesarily think every song in this mix qualifies as "Garage Rock", but they all kinda circle around that style. The combination of lo-fi recording and simple melodies reminds me of the songs I grew up listening to in the car; my mom's oldies station. Nearly every song in this mix owes itself to Motown or the British Invasion. Even _Liar, Liar_, which was a contemporary song from the 60s, but Garage Rock was basically America's answer to the British Invasion.

      Fun Facts!

      - _Hacienda Motel_ is about Sam Cooke's murder at the Hacienda Hotel in Los Angeles, California.
      - _Behind the Wall of Sleep_ was written about Kim Ernst, the bassist for a band called The Bristols-Boston. The lyrics compare her to Jean Shrimpton, a 60s supermodel, and Bill Wyman, the bassist for The Rolling Stones.
      - The Castaways never released a full album. Just a handful of singles.
      - The Castaways released _Liar, Liar_ on a split single with their fellow Minnesotans The Trashmen's _Surfin' Bird_.
      - Fitz and the Tantrums owes its entire existence to lead singer Michael Fitzpatrick acquiring an old Conn electric organ. It features heavily on their debut album _Pickin' Up The Pieces_.
      - The piano parts in _The Beast and Dragon, Adored_ were recorded "illegally" by sneaking into the piano lab at the University of Texas music building with some recording equipment.
      - Say Hi To Your Mom is basically a solo project of Eric Elbogen. Eric has since shortened the name to just "Say Hi". Many Say Hi songs tend to involve vampires, robots, and movie references.

    notes: |
      This mix feels mostly like a sequel to Episode 004 "Wallow".

      Perhaps I should have titled it "Wallow Side B", in keeping with the mix tape theme.

      I guess I like mopey music, or at least I certainly don't shy away from it.

      Hmm, let's see,  what can I say about this mix?

      Fun Facts!

      - Will Johnson is also the lead singer of the bands _South San Gabriel_ and _Centro-matic_.
      - Beck's album _Sea Change_ is one of those rare albums where I can listen to it start to finish and there are no bad tracks I'd rather skip.
      - Despite Idlewild's often country-ish sound... they're Scottish. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
      - Jets to Brazil got their name from a travel poster on the wall in a scene from _Breakfast At Tiffany's_.
      - Mad Season is a "supergroup" consisting of members of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and The Screaming Trees.
      - Peter Murphy is the former lead singer of the pioneering goth band Bauhaus.
      - The Smiths' lead singer Morrissey has made some truly reprehensible statements over the years, but I enjoy his lyrics and vocals in spite of his being a terrible person.
      - Cigarettes After Sex recorded their first EP in a four-story stairway at the University of Texas, El Paso. The quite androgynous sounding lead singer is Greg Gonzales.

      If there's a theme to this mix, I don't know what it is. 

      Just a jumble of songs I like and hope go together.

      Fun Facts!

      - A critic once described Electric Six's music as "macho flippancy" and "tongue-in-cheek pomposity". Lead singer Dick Valentine estimates "90 percent of our songs, maybe even higher than 90 percent are about absolutely nothing."
      - _Comfortably Numb_ is, of course, originally by Pink Floyd. This version reimagines it as a Beegees song.
      - Robert Levon Been, of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, is the son of Michael Been from _The Call_.
      - :wumpscut: was the project of German DJ Rudy Ratzinger. Despite being active from 1991 to 2016, it was a studio-only project and never toured.
      - The movie _Pretty in Pink_ is named after the Psychedelic Furs song. Not the other way around. Molly Ringwald was a fan of the Furs.
      - The instrumental version of _Cells_ has been featured in several movies and movie trailers.
      - Dan Wilson and John Munson of Semisonic were also both members of the band Trip Shakespeare. Both bands have a star on the outside of the iconic First Avenue club in Minneapolis.
      - Mike Doughty, former lead singer of Soul Coughing, has a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/doughty) where he releases songs weekly (if not more frequently).

    name: "Post Rock"
    number: "009"
    tracklist:
      - Talk Talk - The Rainbow
      - Bark Psychosis - Eyes and Smiles
      - Godspeed You! Black Emperor - Moya
      - Grails - Burden of Hope
      - Maserati - Moving With Heavy Hearts
      - Explosions in the Sky - Your Hand in Mine
      - Tortoise - Along the Banks of Rivers
      - Low - Lullaby
    notes: |
      Talk Talk started out as a synthpop band in the early 80s. They had some minor radio hits, most notably the 1984 hit [_It's My Life_](https://youtu.be/cFH5JgyZK1I). However, if you look at Talk Talk's studio discography, there's a very clear trajectory towards something quite different. The first 2 albums are just standard pop. Their 3rd album, _The Colour of Spring_ (1986), hints at a new direction. The track [_April 5th_](https://youtu.be/cRx0rqqTetc) in particular shows what's to come.  Their final 2 albums move away from traditional pop song structures and into free-jazz orchestral soundscapes and pioneered what would later become known as "Post Rock".

      _The Rainbow_ is the opening track from their fourth album _Spirit of Eden_ (1988). Other than Mark Hollis' vocals, it's unrecognizable as the same band that produced _It's My Life_ only 4 years prior.

      The term "Post Rock" was applied retroactively once other bands followed in their footsteps. Bark Psychosis' _Hex_ album helped solidify the term. Post Rock approximately encompasses any music produced using traditional rock instruments, but not following traditional rock structures. The results tend to be long, winding instrumental pieces up to an hour long.
      
      An hour is not a lot of time to fit multiple Post Rock tracks, but this'll have to do.

    name: "Chill"
    number: "010"
    tracklist:
      - William Fitzsimmons - So This Is Goodbye (Pink Ganter remix)
      - Wideband Network - Earthbound
      - MTNS - Fears
      - All Hail The Silence - Looking Glass
      - Tycho - Awake
      - Tame Impala - Feels Like We Only Go Backwards
      - Neon Indian - Polish Girl
      - Washed Out - It All Feels Right
      - The Presets - Girl and the Sea
      - God Lives Underwater - From Your Mouth
    notes: |
      Don't really have much to say about this mix. Probably at least half of these tracks could qualify for the "Chillwave" genre, if that even counts as a genre.

      I saw All Hail The Silence open for Howard Jones in Seattle back in 2019. I was surprised when I discovered the guest vocalist for AHTS was Brian Transeau (a.k.a. "BT") because I had seen BT open for The Crystal Method back in 1998! Thus proving I am old.

      Unintentionally, this mix features 3 bands from Australia. Time to dig up some fun facts!

      - Both William Fitzsimmons' parents are blind. (William is not blind.)
      - Washed Out is probably best known for the theme song to _Portlandia_.
      - MTNS are from Brisbane, Australia.
      - The Presets are from Sydney, Australia.
      - Tame Impala is from Perth, Australia.
      - Vocalist David Reilly of God Lives Underwater died of complications from a tooth infection. Remember to floss.

    name: "Echoes"
    number: "011"
    tracklist:
      - Blaqk Audio - Snuff on Digital
      - The Knife - Heartbeats
      - Wolfsheim - Once in a Lifetime
      - De/Vision - Try to Forget
      - White Lies - Bigger Than Us
      - The Bravery - Time Won't Let Me Go
      - The Chameleons UK - Swamp Thing
      - She Wants Revenge - These Things
      - Ladytron - Destroy Everything You Touch
      - Creux Lies - Portals
      - Editors - Munich
    notes: |
      I think it's safe to say that nearly all of the bands on this playlist were influenced by Joy Division. Definitely a strong post-punk/goth vibe. There's something about the "echo" aesthetic of the music that makes it sound like it was recorded down a long empty hallway.

      I don't think there's a single Aussie or Canadian band in this mix. What is the world coming to?

      An alternate name for this mix could've been "Duos" considering how many of these bands consist of only 2 members.

      Fun facts time!

      - Blaqk Audio is a duo consisting of 2 of the members from the punk band AFI.
      - The Knife is a duo consisting of 2 Swedish siblings.
      - Wolfsheim was a duo from Germany. The vocalist, Peter Heppner, has gone on to collaborate with a lot of other German DJs.
      - De/Vision is also duo from Germany, though they started out as a quartet.
      - The Chameleons UK were formed in 1981. They had to tack on "UK" to their name in the US, because there was already a band called The Chameleons in the US.
      - She Wants Revenge was also a duo, though they toured with additional members.
      - Ladytron's name was taken from the song "Ladytron" by Roxy Music.
      - Editors were previously known as Pilot, The Pride and Snowfield.
